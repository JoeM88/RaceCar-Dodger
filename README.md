# RaceCar-Dodger
First attempt at video programming. 2-D platformer created to understand the core concepts of video programming.

Please save all the files from this project into a single folder.
In order for the game properly work within your computer, you will need the pygame module and python 3.0. 
The pygame module can be downloaded through the pygame website: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
Make sure to dowload the most update version of pygame and with the approproate bit download of your computer.
If your computer is not listed on the pygame website follow this link: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame
For example, if my computer has a windows operating system with 64-bit  I would go to the second link and download
this file: "pygame‑1.9.2a0‑cp35‑none‑win_amd64.whl"

To download python you will visit the python website at: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once everything is downloaded, you will need to reconfigure the files in the proper places.
The current photo and sound directories of the game are set to my directories so you will need to change them to yours.

In line 61 the carImg is currently set to 'racecar.png' you will need to change to wherever you have the carImg saved.
Hopfully it is in the same place as all of the projects files.
For example,the crash sound is set to  C:\\Users\\Joseph Molina\\Desktop\\project2\\crash.wav"
You will need to right-click on the file, click on properties, then you will see "Location" copy that line and replace it within the project.
You will need to do the same for lines:
25 and 22

Once this is all taken care of, the game will be ready for you to play! Hope you Enjoy! Also feel free to contribute as I would like to see this game grow!
